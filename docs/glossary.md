# Glossary

## Technical Terms

**API (Application Programming Interface)** - Interface for communication between frontend and backend systems.

**Autocomplete** - Real-time search suggestions appearing as user types.

**Cosine Similarity** - Mathematical measure of similarity between two vectors (0 = different, 1 = identical). Used to find semantically similar content.

**Docker** - Container platform for packaging and deploying applications.

**Embedding** - Numerical vector representation of text meaning, e.g., [0.23, -0.45, 0.67...]. Enables semantic similarity comparison.

**FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework for building APIs with automatic documentation.

**Fuzzy Search** - Search tolerating typos and misspellings, e.g., "rekrutcja" finds "rekrutacja".

**HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** - Algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces.

**Hybrid Search** - Combining semantic search (embeddings) with keyword matching for better results.

**Offset/Limit Pattern** - Pagination approach using skip (offset) and take (limit) parameters.

**pgvector** - PostgreSQL extension for storing and searching vector embeddings.

**pg_trgm** - PostgreSQL extension for trigram-based fuzzy text matching.

**Semantic Search** - Finding conceptually similar content using ML embeddings rather than exact keyword matching.

**UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)** - 128-bit identifier for database records.

## HR Terms (Domain Context)

**ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** - System for tracking job applications and candidates.

**CV (Curriculum Vitae)** - Professional resume, Polish: "życiorys".

**Exit Interview** - Conversation with departing employee, Polish: "rozmowa wyjściowa".

**FTE (Full-Time Equivalent)** - Measure of employee workload (1.0 = full-time).

**KPI (Key Performance Indicator)** - Metrics for measuring performance, Polish: "wskaźniki efektywności".

**L4** - Colloquial Polish term for sick leave ("zwolnienie lekarskie").

**NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)** - Confidentiality agreement, Polish: "umowa o poufności".

**Onboarding** - Process of integrating new employees into organization.

**Performance Review** - Employee evaluation process, Polish: "ocena pracownicza".

**Recruitment** - Process of finding and hiring new employees, Polish: "rekrutacja".

**Talent Acquisition** - Strategic approach to identifying and acquiring skilled workers.

**Well-being** - Employee wellness and mental health in workplace.

## Metrics & Performance

**Latency** - Time delay between request and response.

**Precision** - Percentage of returned results that are relevant.

**Recall** - Percentage of relevant results that are returned.

**Response Time p95** - 95th percentile response time (95% of requests respond faster than X ms).

**Similarity Threshold** - Minimum cosine similarity score (e.g., 0.7) to consider results relevant.
